## Single and Multiple Linear Regression

## Questions
1. Why did you choose this dataset?
	I chose the game and grade dataset because I am curious as to how gaming affects a student's performance, whether it be positively or negatively.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?
	The linear regression model does not predict student grades very well, as it only explains **18% of the differences in grades** based on parental education. The **scatter plot shows a lot of variation**, meaning the predictions are not very accurate. This suggests that **other important factors affect student grades**, and a more detailed model might be needed for better predictions.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?
	Linear regression is still very relevant today because it is one of the foundations for machine learning and how it is able to predict trends with a given dataset.
